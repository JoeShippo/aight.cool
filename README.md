## About

This portfolio is built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **Material Tailwind Components**. The goal is to present my web development work in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive styling.
- **Material Tailwind**: Tailwind-based components for rapid UI development.
- **Node.js & npm**: For managing packages and scripts.
- **Webpack/Babel**: For module bundling and ES6+ support.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. Then run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

This project can be deployed on any server. The recommended method is to use **Plesk**, with the following steps:

1. **Build the Project**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. **Deploy the `build` Folder to Your Server**

    You can either manually upload the `build` folder or use **Git Deployment** with Plesk.

3. **Configure Your Server**

    - Ensure that the `index.html` file is served correctly.
    - If using React Router, set up proper redirection to `index.html`.
